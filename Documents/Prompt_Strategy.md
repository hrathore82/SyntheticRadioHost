I have used strategic prompt engineering to generate linguistically accurate Hinglish dialogue.
The prompt architecture establishes role-based instruction ("Expert Hinglish Scriptwriter") to activate domain-specific linguistic patterns within the LLM's parameter space. 
It mandates Roman Hindi transliteration for TTS system compatibility. 
The core innovation is the instruction to "blend English keywords into Hindi grammar naturally," addressing Hinglish's code-switching behavior where English lexical items integrate into Hindi morphosyntactic structures. 
The prompt enforces formal register through respectful plural forms ("aap"), maintains strict noun-verb-gender agreement, and requires discourse markers ("matlab", "dekhiye") for authentic conversational flow. 
Structured Example output format with speaker tags (<speaker_A>, <speaker_B>) ensures dialogue clarity.
Length constraints (50-60 words) optimize audio processing, while explicit audio cue integration enables expressive TTS output.

## Key Technical Components

1. **Role-Based Instruction**: Expert Hinglish Scriptwriter persona activation
2. **Script Specification**: Roman Hindi transliteration requirement
3. **Code-Switching Instruction**: English keywords in Hindi grammar
4. **Grammatical Constraints**: Formal register, gender agreement
5. **Discourse Markers**: Natural conversational fillers
6. **Structured Output Format with Example**: Speaker tags for dialogue clarity with Example
8. **Audio Cue Integration**: TTS-compatible markers
9. **Artifact Elimination**: No meta-commentary constraint
