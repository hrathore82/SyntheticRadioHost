I have used a multi-layered prompt engineering strategy to generate linguistically accurate Hinglish dialogue. The prompt architecture employs role-based instruction ("Expert Hinglish Scriptwriter") to establish domain-specific context, enabling the LLM to access relevant linguistic patterns. The script specification mandates Roman Hindi transliteration, ensuring compatibility with text-to-speech systems while maintaining linguistic authenticity. The critical instruction to "blend English keywords into Hindi grammar naturally" addresses code-switching behavior characteristic of Hinglish, where lexical items from English are integrated into Hindi morphosyntactic structures. Grammatical constraints enforce formal register through respectful plural forms and maintain morphosyntactic agreement (noun-verb-gender alignment). The inclusion of discourse markers ("matlab", "dekhiye", "waise") facilitates natural conversational flow, while explicit audio cue integration enables multimodal output generation. Length constraints optimize for audio processing.
